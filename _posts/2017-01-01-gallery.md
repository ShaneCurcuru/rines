# Gallery Of Past Work

**David** if you like this general site design, we can find gallery plugin code that would let you simply list a set of pictures, and have them appear in a similar (but not identical) gallery you can click on in your current site.  

<div class="box alt">
  <div class="row 50% uniform">
    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <!-- Break -->
    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img4.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <!-- Break -->
    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img5.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img6.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

There are a lot of gallery plugins out there - it's fairly easy to find a decent one, although you sort of get what you find.  Tweaking little details about edges or exactly how the pictures are displayed within a single gallery plugin is usually not worth the work.  It's easiest to find a good enough one (and there are some great ones) and just leave the detailed layout alone.  

Focus on better descriptions and newer pictures instead!
