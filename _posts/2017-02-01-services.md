## Tree & Shrub Pruning

We approach prunning both as an art form as well as a science. We prune to meet your objectives and to improve the look of your trees and shrubs while keeping their biological, structural, and health requirements in mind.

## Planting & Landscaping

Putting the right plant in the right place for the right reason is essential to a successful landscaping project. We pay close attention to selecting plants best suited to your property, choosing healthy speciments from local nurseries, and employing proper installation techniques.

## Tree Removals & Hazard Assessments

In addition to tree removal services, we also offer expertise in assessing tree hazard risk. We provide tree hazard assessment services to residential, municipal, and commercial clients.

## Tree Inventories

We offer expertise in conducting computerized tree inventories using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We have recently completed work in the Boston Common, the Public Garden, and The Esplanade.

## Tree Protection/Preservation Consultation

We provide pre-construction planning for protecting and preserving trees during construction. We also provide guidance on determining which trees are worth preserving.
