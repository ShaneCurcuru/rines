<h2 id="certified-insured-experienced">Certified. Insured. Experienced.</h2>

<p>Rines ArborWorks, LLC provides high-end tree and landscape services to clients throughout the Greater Boston area. Company owner David Rines is a Massachusetts Certified Arborist with a buisness background and more than twenty years experience in landscaping and arboriculture.</p>

<p>We offer year-round expertise to improve the health of your plants and the value of your property.
David began working for tree companies in the mid 1980s and found he had an artistic eye for pruning. During the 1990’s, he provided pruning services to a growing list of clients, working out of his Volvo station wagon, while employed full time in the computer and financial services industries.</p>

<p>In 2003, David took the plunge to establish Rines ArborWorks while earning a Masters in Urban Forestry from the school of Natural Resources Conservation at the University of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>With his experience and education combined—including a Masters in Business Administration—David brings art and science to tree and shrub care and landscaping; always with a client-centric view on how to bring the best value to the property and the project.</p>

<p>
  <span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/isa_small_logo.gif" alt="" /></span>
  Rines ArborWorks recently completed an update of the GIS-based tree inventory on The Esplanade in Boston. The objective of this project was to verify, modify and update the existing computerized inventory so that it accurately represents the present-day location, description, and condition of the trees in The Esplanade. Results will be used as part of new tree maintenance initiatives.

        <p><h1 id="gallery-of-past-work">Gallery Of Past Work</h1>

<p><strong>David</strong> if you like this general site design, we can find gallery plugin code that would let you simply list a set of pictures, and have them appear in a similar (but not identical) gallery you can click on in your current site.</p>

<div class="box alt">
  <div class="row 50% uniform">
    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <!-- Break -->
    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img4.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <!-- Break -->
    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img5.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
    <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/img6.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are a lot of gallery plugins out there - it’s fairly easy to find a decent one, although you sort of get what you find.  Tweaking little details about edges or exactly how the pictures are displayed within a single gallery plugin is usually not worth the work.  It’s easiest to find a good enough one (and there are some great ones) and just leave the detailed layout alone.</p>

<p>Focus on better descriptions and newer pictures instead!</p>
